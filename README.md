## CraftOfExile
Personal project. Aplication created as a simple crafting system for game Path of Exile. The main idea is to let user pick an item and modify it using orbs. Project is written in C++.

## Future of project
So far I've created basic logic without much implementation on user side. Currently I am working on making the app interact with the user by allowing him to create simple items using basic orb types.
